### ORACY@JPS
---------

The 6-year Oracy@JPS programme aims to strengthen students’ foundation in language skills and competencies. It leverages on various platforms to hone students’ language skills and build their confidence in order for them to become effective and confident speakers.

Through fun-filled activities and a balance between planned and spontaneous talk, students sharpen their skills such as intonation, articulation, body posture and voice projection. The programme also increases the emphasis on the development of 21CC and values for effective communication.

Primary 1 - Show & Tell <br>
Primary 2 – Pick & Tell <br>
Primary 3 – Readers’ Theatre <br>
Primary 4 - Read & Report <br>
Primary 5 - Perspective-taking <br>
