### ORACY@JPS
---------

The 6-year Oracy@JPS programme aims to strengthen students’ foundation in language skills and competencies. It leverages on various platforms to hone students’ language skills and build their confidence in order for them to become effective and confident speakers.

The focus for each level is as follows:

Primary 1 - Show & Tell
