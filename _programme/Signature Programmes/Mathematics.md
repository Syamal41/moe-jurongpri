### YouM.A.T.H! @JPS - You Make Amazing Things Happen!
--------------------------------------------------

In 2017, the Mathematics Department initiated YouM.A.T.H! @JPS - **You** **M** ake **A** mazing **T** hings **H**appen! This movement aims to inculcate joy in learning Mathematics and develop a culture of curiosity and enthusiasm towards the subject. It is designed with the end in mind that every student in JPS is able and want to learn Mathematics. This programme consists of assembly talks, activities and other targeted sub-programmes where students are introduced to interesting mathematical knowledge and attend Math enrichment sessions catered to their capabilities. All Mathematics teachers in JPS believe that students can progress in the subject at their own pace and experience the wonders Mathematics can bring to their daily lives. In the classrooms, teachers also leverage on formative assessment and engaging teaching pedagogies to monitor and support students’ holistic mastery in Mathematics.
