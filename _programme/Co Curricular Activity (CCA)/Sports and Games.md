**Sports and Games**

Sports and games play an essential role in our students' education. Participating in physical activities not only helps children develop their motor skills but also promotes their physical, mental, and social well-being. By engaging in sports and games, students can improve their physical fitness, coordination, balance, and flexibility, which are all important for leading a healthy lifestyle.

Furthermore, sports and games provide a fun and engaging way for students to learn important life skills such as teamwork, communication, and sportsmanship. Through team sports, students learn how to work with others towards a common goal, communicate effectively, and respect the abilities and opinions of their peers. They also learn how to handle success and failure in a positive manner, which is a crucial aspect of developing resilience and grit.

In addition, sports and games can help improve students' academic performance. Studies have shown that regular physical activity can enhance cognitive function, improve memory, and increase attention span, all of which can contribute to better academic performance. 

By incorporating sports and games into the curriculum, we at JPS can help our students become well-rounded individuals who are physically and mentally fit, capable of working collaboratively, and prepared to face life's challenges with confidence and resilience.
