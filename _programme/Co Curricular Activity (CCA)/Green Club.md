Environmental Science Club
==========


### Activities/ Training Description
--------------------------------

The Environmental Science Club is about going ‘green’ and caring for our environment. We conduct lessons and activities to teach and train all our members about the 3Rs - Reducing, Recycling and Reusing. These 3Rs are important for conserving and preserving our environment and its resources.   
  
Our activities are both fun and exciting. From hands-on growing of our own greenery in the school compound to participating in learning journeys where our members can learn the various recycling efforts implemented in our country, our members get to experience and practise the 3Rs. In addition, we also conduct various experiments and surveys around the school to study how we can be more effective in going ‘green’.   
  
Our environment needs our help and together, we can make a difference! Join the Environmental Science Club now and make that difference.
