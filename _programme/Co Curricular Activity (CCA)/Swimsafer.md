**Swimsafer**

![](/images/swimsafer02.jpg)

The school organised a SwimSafer programme for all Primary 5 students as part of the MOE - SportSG Co-Funding Scheme. As part of the Physical Education curriculum, the programme aims to allow the students to gain confidence, develop independence in the water and learn general and deep-end water safety.

For students who do not know how to swim, they were introduced to water skills such as forward and backward movement, entering and exiting the pool safely and introduction to personal water survival skills. Those who already have swimming qualifications were assessed by the coaches based on their competencies and placed in other progressive swimming stages. Half of the cohort had their training at the Bukit Batok Swimming Complex while the others had theirs at the Clementi Swimming Complex.
