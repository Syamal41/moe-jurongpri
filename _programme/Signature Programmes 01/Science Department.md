Science Department
==================

  

In JPS, the science department aims to provide experiential learning platforms for students to increase interest in Science and reinforce Science concepts. Students are given engaging, exciting and exploratory experiences in ScienceÂ 

The Science Alive Programme is a signature JPS science programme where students have to apply science process skills such as analysing and creative problem solving. This programme is conducted for all students from P3 to P6. For instance, in the P5 Science Alive Programme, students applied their knowledge of closed circuits and made an electric wire buzzing game. It encouraged them to think creatively as they had to create the most difficult wire pattern for their wire buzzing game!
