Science 
==================

In JPS, the Science Department aims to provide experiential learning platforms for students to increase their interest in the subject and reinforce their learning. Students are given engaging, exciting and exploratory experiences in science.

The Science Alive programme is a signature JPS Science Department programme where students have to apply science process skills such as planning, analysing data and creative problem solving. The goal is to bring out the Joy of Learning in Science for our students and cultivate important 21st Century Competencies. Through the Science Alive programme, our students got to experience hands-on learning, apply science concepts and engage in the practices of science. For instance, in the P3 Science Alive Programme, our students had to apply their knowledge of materials to create a boat which could hold the most weights. It encouraged the students to think creatively and they learnt science and had fun in the process!
