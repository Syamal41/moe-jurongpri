Counselling Programme
=====================

  

As a support to the Pupil Management Department, the counselling service in Jurong Primary School aims to build resiliency in our JPS students to be citizens who ‘reach in' to ‘reach out' to others as they themselves meet the challenges in life.

  

A full-time counselor is in school to provide counselling service on behavioural and emotional issues of pupils. Issues related to the pupil's well-being are discussed with the pupil and appropriate solutions and interventions are implemented to him overcome his difficulties. Pertinent information pertaining to the well-being of the child is shared with teachers and the parents. Parents and teachers use the information and do further follow-up for these pupils.

A part-time counselor is also attached to the school to provide additional support in counselling.

  

Pupils with emotional and behavioural difficulties can self-refer themselves to the counsellor while others are referred by their teachers
