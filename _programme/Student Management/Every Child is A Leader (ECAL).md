As the school’s Learning for Life Programme, Every Child A Leader (ECAL) nurtures in students strong life habits and leadership skills.

We believe that every child can become an influential leader and make a difference to their community, Singapore and the world.

We aim to develop our children into:
* Self-confident individuals who seek continued self-improvement
* Effective communicators and team players
* Future-ready leaders who serve the community

**The Leader In Me (TLIM)**

Our LLP is anchored on _The Leader in Me_ (_TLIM_) – the children’s version of the more popularly-known [_7 Habits of Highly Effective People_](https://jurongpri.moe.edu.sg/qql/slot/u560/Programme/Every%20Child%20Is%20a%20Leader/7HabitsTree.pdf) by Stephen Covey.

All JPS students go through a thorough TLIM curriculum which teaches them simple but powerful life habits such as:

* Self-management
* Understanding and managing emotions
* Setting and achieving positive goals
* Working and playing well with others
* Feeling and showing empathy
* Establishing and maintaining positive relationships
* Self-improvement and self-care
* Self-reflection and positive routines

**6 Traits of JPS Leaders**

Strong leadership skills are indispensable to our children as they progress in life. Our LLP also brings JPS students through a curriculum which revolves around them learning key leadership traits, both theoretically in the classroom and hands-on as they take on roles and responsibilities throughout their JPS years.

Here, learning begins as early as in the Lower Primary years as students go through a 20-hour lesson series and subsequently work on their _Junior Leadership Challenge_.

Students further internalize these traits they take on leadership roles within the class and the school, and when they lead their class and schoolmates in programmes such as _Make a Change @ JPS_ (see below).

**JPS Prefects and Leaders**

Deserving Prefects and CCA Leaders are officially appointed during the annual Student Leaders’ Investiture. This affirms student leaders for their commitment, effort and school contributions and also highlights the importance JPS places on the grooming of its next echelon of leaders.

Every year, all prefects and CCA Leaders undergo leadership training sessions by an appointed vendor, learning skills such as active listening, conflict management and creativity. The Prefect EXCO also participates in a series of leadership conversations with School Leaders.

Putting their learning into practice, JPS prefects play active roles in the planning and execution of the school’s annual commemorative events such as Racial Harmony Day and National Day.

They also serve the school through roles such as assembly parade commander and recess I/Cs. These opportunities were invaluable in teaching them leadership skills such as responsibility, project management, problem solving and collaboration.

**Make A Change**

_Make a Change @ JPS_ is a school-wide programme which inculcates in all students the will and know-how to make a difference to the world around them.

Here, students work in groups to identify problems in their class, school or community, propose feasible solutions to these problems, and actually go ahead to implement the change they want to see.

Done over a few cycles each year to scaffold students into a continual life practice, every JPS student who have, by the time of graduation more than a dozen improvement projects.
