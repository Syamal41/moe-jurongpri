The Pupil Leadership Programme
==============================
 

### Prefect Rally 

As a pinnacle of our Leadership Development Programme, eight out of forty P6 prefects were selected based on their outstanding performance in the course of their leadership journey. They rallied for their schoolmates’ votes as they vied for the position of the Head Prefect. All students were empowered to vote for a suitable candidate that they felt would best represent them in school.
