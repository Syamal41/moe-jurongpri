_Make a Change @ JPS_ is a school-wide programme which inculcates in all students the will and know-how to make a difference to the world around them.

Here, students work in groups to identify problems in their class, school or community, propose feasible solutions to these problems, and actually go ahead to implement the change they want to see.

Done over a few cycles each year to scaffold students into a continual life practice, every JPS student who have, by the time of graduation more than a dozen improvement projects.
