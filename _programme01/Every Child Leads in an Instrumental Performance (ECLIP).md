Every Child Leads in an Instrumental Performance (ECLIP)
========================================================

  
The ECLIP programme is Jurong Primary School's unique music cum leadership programme that each child will go through. Within the programme, students are exposed to a variety of music instruments ranging from percussive ones like the boomwhackers right up to the keyboard. As individuals, students demonstrate leading self by mastery of the instruments. With their friends, students demonstrate leading peers by acclimatizing to group dynamics. In a group, students demonstrate leading team by heightening the collective strength and talents of the team in a performance. In different subject disciplines, we provide students various opportunities to showcase creativity, and the skills of effective communication and leadership.
