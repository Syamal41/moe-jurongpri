<b>Information</b>

### Activities/ Training Description
--------------------------------

Students in this CCA will be working in groups of 4-5, where they will be engaged actively in building and programming using LEGO MINDSTORMS software kit. LEGO MINDSTORMS is a programmable robotics construction set that gives students the power to build, program and command their own LEGO robots. Students can make the robots walk, move and do whatever they can imagine.Â  With each of the training session, students will have the opportunity to participate in the National Robotics Programming Competition (NPRC), as well as National Robotics Competition (NRC), both held during the school holidays.
