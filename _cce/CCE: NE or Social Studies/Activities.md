### Total Defence Day
------

“Together We Keep Singapore Strong” is the theme for this year’s Total Defence Day. The focus of the commemoration was on Digital Defence. To highlight the importance of Cyber Wellness, students were taught how to apply S.A.R. (Be Secure, Be Alert and Be Responsible) on online platforms. In addition, we invited our ex-student, Tay Gao Jun, to conduct dialogue sessions with our student leaders on Cybersecurity. He is one of 150 people in the world to hold the title of Certified Ethical Hacker Master   
  
It was timely that we guided our students on how they can play their part as a citizen using Civil and Psychological Defences as we braved the pandemic as a nation. Students were given the opportunity to show their appreciation to essential workers at JPS by penning ‘Thank you’ notes to our JPS support staff as well as our frontline staff such as nurses and doctors. A collage was also created by our students and presented to healthcare workers of Ng Teng Fong Hospital.

### International Friendship Day
------

The school commemorated International Friendship Day on 6 April 2020. The theme for this year was “Beyond Borders”. Friendships across national boundaries is established and maintained through mutual understanding, respect and commitment. With this in mind, the school lined up a series of meaningful activities to engage students in the commemoration of IFD this year.   

  

The assembly programmes talked about the spirit of friendship and interconnectedness between Singapore and other countries around the world. In the face of COVID-19 pandemic, our students got to hear and share about how Singapore, being a member of a global community of nations, had extended help to other countries in times of need.   

  

Students also spent time exploring the various countries ‘assigned’ to them via the  Student Learning Space. They then embarked on virtual flights to the various countries with their uniquely-designed JPS Passports, and participated in the tasks and puzzles assigned in their very own passports. Through the various activities, students get to appreciate the friendship and collaboration among different countries and will remember them in the years to come.

### Racial Harmony Day
-----

Jurong Primary School commemorated Racial Harmony Day (RHD) 2020 on 13 July 2020. This year’s theme is Multicultural Singapore. Besides an interesting assembly programme, our students had in-depth class discussions about racial issues and shared their reflections on paper hearts which they designed themselves. The RHD team also prepared a special learning package on the Singapore Student Learning Portal (SLS) to engage students to learn more about the diverse races in Singapore through fun activities such as quizzes, songs and even a virtual tour.  
  
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought issues of racism to the fore. Social cohesion is especially important during times like this. Viruses do not discriminate, people do. It is especially important during this period that we stay united so we can emerge a stronger and cohesive Singapore. The activities and the rich discussions amongst students and staff paved the way for an ever deeper understanding and appreciation of racial cohesion.
