### Total Defence Day
------

“Together We Keep Singapore Strong” is the theme for this year’s Total Defence Day. The focus of the commemoration was on Digital Defence. To highlight the importance of Cyber Wellness, students were taught how to apply S.A.R. (Be Secure, Be Alert and Be Responsible) on online platforms. In addition, we invited our ex-student, Tay Gao Jun, to conduct dialogue sessions with our student leaders on Cybersecurity. He is one of 150 people in the world to hold the title of Certified Ethical Hacker Master   
  
It was timely that we guided our students on how they can play their part as a citizen using Civil and Psychological Defences as we braved the pandemic as a nation. Students were given the opportunity to show their appreciation to essential workers at JPS by penning ‘Thank you’ notes to our JPS support staff as well as our frontline staff such as nurses and doctors. A collage was also created by our students and presented to healthcare workers of Ng Teng Fong Hospital.
