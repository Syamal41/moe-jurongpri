Programmes
==========

### National Education
------------------

  

<b>Learning Journeys / Heritage Tours for Every Level</b> <br>
The school believes that every pupil must know their heritage before they can appreciate it. As such, the school arranges Learning Journeys / Heritage Tours for every level of pupils so that they can be acquainted with things that make Singapore tick. The programme outline for the year is as follows:

  

*   P1 - Jacob Ballas Children's Garden
*   P2 - Singapore Philatelic Museum
*   P3 - Singapore Zoological Garden
*   P4 - Kampong Glam
*   P5 - Little India
*   P6 - Chinatown

  

These learning journeys will be refined as necessary to stay relevant with the needs of the students.  
  
Â 

<b>Integrated Project Work (IPW)</b> <br>
In addition to the MOE curriculum that pupils go through during Social Studies lessons, pupils are also given the opportunity to embark on mini-projects every semester to translate what they've learnt into meaningful products. Pupils work in groups to create attractive products and learn more about teamwork, research methods and Singapore heritage at the same time.

Extended Commemorative Days (Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day, National Day) <br>
We believe that the celebration of commemorative days should not be confined to a day. Instead, we make it a week-long activity whereby pupils can explore different facets of the Commemorative Day. This gives pupils a more meaningful and enriching experience and helps them appreciate the significance of the Commemorative Day.
