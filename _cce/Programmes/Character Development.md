Character Development
=====================

![](/images/CDP.jpg)


The whole-school approach to character development in JPS is based on an integrated Character Development School Framework which is anchored on values and focuses on equipping Jurong Primary pupils with Lifeskills, Leadership opportunities and Citizenship through an awareness-appreciation-action approach.   
  

Pupils are taught explicitly how to demonstrate these values through assembly talks and Lifeskills lessons. To strengthen pupils’ Social Emotional Learning (SEL) competencies, life skills lessons have been revised and schemes of work for the various subjects have been looked into to find out how SEL can be incorporated into the curriculum.
