Values In Action (VIA)
======================


JPS students serve to learn & learn to serve. We want them to have ownership over how they contribute to the community, apply the values they have learnt into practice, and continue to contribute meaningfully. The activities they are involved in are segmented into 3 broad areas and this segmentation allows our students to be involved in age appropriate community work.

*   Within School
*   Within Community
*   Community-at-Large
