### Value Champion
--------------

At Jurong Primary School, Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) plays an important role in helping us to achieve our school mission to nurture all-rounded pupils of grace, distinction and sound moral values. In light of an ever-changing world, we hope that our students will be anchored in values and develop strong social-emotional competencies, ready to face whatever comes their way.

**Overview:**

The Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Department oversees programmes and activities that provide opportunities for our students to develop their social-emotional competencies and be rooted in our school core values of **Passion**, **Care**, **Responsibility, Integrity** and **Respect**.

CCE 2021 is a refreshed Character and Citizenship Education experience for our students and we are committed to a school-wide implementation of CCE such as in the following areas:

●         Character Development

●         Citizenship Education and Social Studies

●         Guidance Modules (Education and Career Guidance / Cyber Wellness / Sexuality Education)

●         Values in Action


**Our Key Programmes:**

_Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)_

CCE (FTGP) lessons are taught by all form teachers, with emphasis on explicit teaching of social-emotional competencies. Form teachers connect with students through stories, scenarios and games to reinforce teaching and learning of values, developing social-emotional competencies and nurturing citizenship dispositions.

_Assembly Sessions and Talks_

Assembly sessions are arranged to share pertinent issues with our students for further discussion in the classroom. An example is our Inclusive Assembly, reminding the community at JPS that we all have a part to play in contributing to a caring and enabling environment.

_Value Champion_

We love catching our students doing good. We celebrate our students who are exemplary in displaying our school core values through this platform, recognising different values in each term:

●        Term 1: Respect and Responsibility
