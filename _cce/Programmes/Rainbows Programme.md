Rainbows Programme
==================

  

The Rainbows Programme provides support to children who are grieving over death of a parent or divorce in a family. It aims to include children from a myriad of loss or painful transitions. Trained facilitators LISTEN to these children while they share their grief story.

  

Pupils are identified by their teachers and parental consent is sought before the child is enrolled into the session. The facilitators work closely with the child through the road of self-discovery and self-healing process. Facilitators assist the grieving children by offering them support and avenue to talk about their feelings and emotions about their grief. If the facilitator or the child feels that they require further medical / emotional / psychological help, referral will be made to seek assistance.

  

Besides the interactive group sessions, there is also individual counselling for the parents and their children.
