Principal's Message
=======================

<img src="/images/Principal.jpeg" style="width:183px;height:240px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right">


Jurong Primary School enjoys a long and rich history spanning over 70 years in Western Singapore. Beginning humbly at Old Jurong Road in 1950, the school has grown as generation after generation of students and families traverse through the portals of this school. With its historic merger with Boon Lay Primary in 2006, and aptly themed “nova initio", Jurong Primary forged forward with a strong identity whilst preserving the best of both schools’ unique heritage and distinctive strengths.   
  
As JPS’s fourth Principal since merger, and against a post-COVID, [BANI](https://thinkinsights.net/leadership/bani/) (i.e., Brittle, Anxious, Non-linear and Incomprehensible) world, one question on our minds is how JPS will stay relevant, responsive and, more importantly, committed to nurturing students to be passionate and lifelong learners. In this new season, together with my staff, we hope to forge a new direction as we consider the needs of our students and their families in response to changes that lie ahead in a post-COVID Singapore.   
  
To our stakeholders, including current and former students, alumnus, parents, community partners, I invite you to work with my staff and teachers to, as one village, raise up students to be gracious, passionate, introspective (i.e., Reach in to reach out) and values-driven citizens. Here, we seek your support to partner us in providing our students with learning experiences that help them to be forward-looking and others-seeking.   
  
As we step into 2023, there is much excitement and hope in what JPS can achieve as the country opens up. This signifies a new chapter for JPS and a new season to build on that which already has been established by my predecessors - Mrs Constance Yip, Mrs Manokara S. and Mr Robin Ong. It is my sincere hope that we can continue to partner with you to move JPS forward together.   
  
Thank you for joining and serving alongside us.   
  
Yours in service.
